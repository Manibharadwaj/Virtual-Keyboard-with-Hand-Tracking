# Virtual-Keyboard-with-Hand-Tracking

This project implements a **virtual keyboard** using Python and computer vision. By tracking finger movements via a webcam, users can interact with the keyboard to "type" without physical contact. It's a hands-free, futuristic input system that combines computer vision and interactive technology.

## 🌟 Features

- **Hand Tracking**: Tracks hand and finger positions using a webcam.
- **Virtual Typing**: Users can "type" on a keyboard by moving their hands.
- **Interactive Video Mode**: Plays a video when the program starts to enhance the user experience.
- **Python-Powered**: Built using Python libraries for simplicity and portability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time video processing.
- **Mediapipe**: For hand and finger tracking.
- **Tkinter (optional)**: For graphical interface (if used).
